# Documentation infrastructure
This repo contains the reusable infrastructure for the documentation websites curated and deployed by ACCESS-NRI.

## Templates
The [templates](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/documentation-infra/blob/main/templates) folder contains templates to be copied into documentation websites following the instruction at the beginning of the template files. 

They are organized into directories that mirror their intended location in the repository. For example, `templates/.readthedocs.yaml` should be copied to the repository root, while `templates/.github/workflows/check_links.yml` should be copied to the `.github/workflows` directory.
